# What is a conditional?

part of the code program that determines the next steps, whether going forward or branching off;
it controls the flow of the execution of the program

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

You use the single equal symbol = to assign a value to a variable
i.e. A = 5
you use the double equal symbol == when you want to check for equality on both sides of the ==
i.e. 65 == 40 + 25
